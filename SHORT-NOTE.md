## Challenges faced in this project

- I never use Svelte and Sveltekit before, so I spent 2 days to do the tutorial in the Svelte and Sveltekit documentation before start building the app
- I never work with geojson data before, so I spent some time to understand about geojson and how to implement it in the leaflet
- I found that the data flow in the Sveltekit quite challenging, so I need to understand it better later
- With some stacks that I never used before and a short time target, I need to manage the time and work carefully

## Trade-offs or shortcuts made

- I think that the official documentation of the leaflet and jspdf is not too detailed, so I need to find other source for reference such as blog or other's repositories to make example of it
- Some of the html component are pre-built component like the login form to make it quick and looks tidy
- For some part that I don't understand, I look at other's repositories that has similar case or at least has similar concept

## What would be extended even further

- The UI is still not responsive, it is still only effective on 1024 px resolution, needs to be adjusted for tablet and mobile screen
- Sidebar design still plain, needs design rework to make user experience better
- Add other map feature such as mark or destination line, so it is more interactive and can give more information
- Add grouping based on continent
